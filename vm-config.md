## System Overview

- **Hostname:** MORPHEUS
- **Role:** Application / Test Server
- **Environment:** Home Lab 3.0
- **Criticality:** MEDIUM

MORPHEUS is used to host test applications, services, and scenarios that generate
controlled activity for monitoring, detection, and learning purposes.

---

## Operating System

- **OS:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
- **Architecture:** x86_64
- **Patch Strategy:** Controlled via APT

---

## Network Configuration

- **VLAN:** 20 (SERVERS)
- **IP Address:** 172.16.20.100
- **Subnet Mask:** /24
- **Default Gateway:** 172.16.20.1 (MikroTik)

---

## DNS & Name Resolution

- **Primary DNS:** KRANG (Active Directory DNS)
- **Upstream Resolver:** Cloudflare (via KRANG)
- **Public DNS locally configured:** ❌ No

This ensures consistent resolution and logging across the lab.

---

## Application Role

MORPHEUS serves as a flexible platform for:

- Web applications
- Vulnerable services
- Custom test tools
- Traffic and log generation

Applications hosted here are **intentionally isolated** from core services.

---

## Logging & Monitoring

- **Wazuh Agent:** Installed
- **Logs Forwarded:**
  - System logs
  - Application logs (where applicable)

Events generated by MORPHEUS are used to:
- Validate SOC detection
- Test correlation rules
- Simulate incidents

---

## Security Posture

- Minimal exposed services
- No sensitive data stored
- Fast rebuild preferred over hardening
- Monitored continuously by SOC

---

## Known Limitations

- Non-hardened by design
- Single instance
- No backup strategy (rebuild instead)

---

## Change Control

Changes to applications or services must be:
- Documented
- Intentionally scoped
- Reversible

---

## Status

- VM operational
- Integrated with SOC
- Actively used for testing
